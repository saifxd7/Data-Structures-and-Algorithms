How to analyze Time Complexity?

Running time depends upon:
    1. single vs multi processofa-rotate-180
    2. Read/ Write speed to memory
    3. 32 bit vs 64 bit
      |-> We don't bother about this all factors 

    4. Input 
        |-> rate of growth of time

Example: 
1.   sum(a, b){
        return a+b
    }

    Time taken = 2 -> taking only constant
    So, TC (Time Complexity) -> Constant Time

2.  sumofList(A, n){
        total = 0
        for i=0 to n-1
            total = total + Ai
        return total
    }

    Cost          no. of times
    1        ->      1
    2        ->    n + 1
    2        ->      n
    1        ->      1

    TSumofList = 1 + 2(n+1) + 2n + 1 
               = 4n + 4
               = Cn + C`  -> O(n) -> Linear Time

    TSumofMatrix = an^2 + bn + c -> O(n^2) -> Quadratic time
